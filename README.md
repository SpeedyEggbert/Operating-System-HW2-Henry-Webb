A Program that implements the bankers alogrithem

Written in C++

## How to run

Complies and runs on both Windows and Linux

The data.txt file must be in the same spot as banker.cpp for it to work.

Output of the program will be put in the same location as banker.cpp so it's best to run it in it's own isolated folder.

## What it does

The program reads off text file all the info about the state of five diffrent "processes" and the "memory".
Using this data it uses the bankers algoritem to find the safe sequence, if it exists and outputs it into a text file called "output.txt"
